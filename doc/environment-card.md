# Proposal: Introducing **"Environment Cards"**

I’d like to propose a new gameplay system called **Environment Cards**.  
The idea is simple: **at the beginning of each fight (each enemy), the game randomly draws three Environment Cards that modify the global rules of that fight**.

This creates dramatic round-to-round variation and adds a new layer of strategy on top of our existing “21-point + item card” system.

## Why Environment Cards?

1. **Increased Replayability**: Each fight feels different because the rules changes.
2. **Stronger Roguelike Identity**: This system introduces “run-defining modifiers,” similar to what Hades, Balatro, Slay the Spire, and Risk of Rain.
3. **Easy to Implement, High Design Value**: Environment Cards are lightweight from a technical perspective, but good to extend the depth of the game.
