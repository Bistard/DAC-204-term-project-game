## Game Overview

"Last Hand" is a single‑player, deck‑based rogue‑lite set in a border‑town casino. You play a down‑on‑his‑luck gambler bringing a "last hand" of cards to face a roster of AI opponents. These opponents share one ruleset but are tuned into different procedural personalities—greedy, cautious, or erratic—so they feel like memorable table characters ("the sheriff who loves to overdraw," "the old con man who plays dead") rather than abstract numbers. At the hand level, the game keeps Blackjack’s core: push close to a target total (usually 21) without busting and beat the opponent’s points. At the run level, you try to survive a chain of stages, earning money and items under tougher environments and penalties. Across runs, meta‑progression unlocks max health, backpack slots, and new rule combinations so failure still moves the long‑term plan forward. Normal mode is a finite sequence of stages that delivers clear closure; endless mode removes a hard endpoint and focuses on long‑term resource and risk management. Each run loops through four phases:
- Setup: Load save data, set health and backpack capacity, roll environments and penalties, and pick an opponent.  
- Drawing and actions: Alternate hit / stand; AI follows simple personalities, and you can trigger one‑shot items to bend the rules.  
- Resolution: Compare points, apply penalty effects, then environment effects, and show a concise report.  
- Rewards: Wins grant loot and coins, which convert into meta‑currency at the end of the run.
Core resources are health, card draws, and consumable items. Penalties turn lost rounds into HP loss, environments and items reshape what counts as a "good" draw, and coins plus upgrades stretch decisions across multiple runs, creating situations where "one more card" can either fuel a huge comeback or throw away the entire run.

## Dramatic and Experience

"Gambling your fate with your last hand in a border town" is the core premise of this game. The humble town, the closed gambling table, and the cold "penalty notices" on the wall together create a slightly oppressive sense of danger. Each penalty card is both a rule and a subtextual line from this shady establishment: you know you're sitting at an unfair table, but you still want to see if you can somehow beat it.

So every time players sit down at the table, they naturally project a bit of "this might be my last chance to turn things around." Meanwhile, light‑touch copy and UI details hint at the town's backstory, turning the table into a small crack in the larger world rather than a pure system in a void. Within a single game, tension comes from three moments: the hesitation as you creep toward the bust threshold, the pop when items intervene, and the emotional swing at the moment of resolution. At the run level, challenge comes from the stepwise stacking of penalties and environments: the deeper you go, the more "ridiculous" things get, but the more chances you have to create a legendary run.

Loot choices between stages and upgrades in the main menu are intentionally designed as "breathing spaces." Here players can briefly step out of counting mode and turn that string of greedy bets and lucky escapes into a concrete plan for "how to play the next one." The emotional curve I hope to deliver starts from curiosity and cautious probing, passes through rounds of "just one more card" greed and anxiety, and finally settles into a self‑driven impulse: "next time I'm definitely going to play better." That way, the game doesn't devolve into a pure random score grinder, but feels more like a long‑form gamble with rises, falls, and a sense of story.

## Design and Development Iteration

The starting idea was to stretch Blackjack’s "one more card can flip everything" tension across the long arc of a rogue‑lite run. To do that, I built four interacting layers—environments, penalties, items, and meta upgrades—where environments and penalties shape baseline risk, items create spikes inside a run, and meta keeps failed runs meaningful. Implementation was split into relatively independent modules:

- A base drawing and scoring system that rules can override  
- A penalty system supporting different damage curves  
- An environment system that changes how cards are evaluated  
- One‑shot items that can interrupt the normal flow  
- A meta‑economy that carries long‑term numbers

These modules talk through a small, clear API so new cards, enemies, or environments can be added without rewriting core logic. Core rules are written generically, while fragile parts like damage formulas and environment effects live in data/config, so most balancing after playtests is just parameter tuning instead of code changes. After the first playable build, iteration mainly focused on three axes. For readability, UI and copy now more clearly separate environments, penalties, and items so players can immediately see "what just hurt me." For difficulty and pacing, early penalty damage was reduced, more healing/defensive options and perfect‑score rewards were added, and the early curve was pulled back toward "tense but fair." For strategy and drama, we introduced more extreme items and environments—forcing enemy draws, rewriting win conditions, or locking item types—so late‑game decisions feel like genuinely risky big moves rather than minor tweaks.

## Representative Playtest Observations

New players are often overwhelmed by the three‑layer rule set and default to gut‑feeling hit/stand, barely reading penalties, environments, or items. To help them ramp up, I plan to gate complexity: only surface the most core rules in the opening rounds, gradually unlock more combinations, and give strong audiovisual feedback the first time a key item is used so players quickly realize "this matters." Players with card‑game experience usually stabilize on clear strategies: fixed‑damage penalties encourage cautious play, while damage‑by‑difference pushes them toward high‑risk, high‑reward bursts. However, under some extreme environment combinations (for example, auto‑draw plus high‑bust cards), testers feel certain runs are "doomed from the start," and powerful items sit unused in overfull backpacks. Future tuning includes adding compensating tools in extreme environments, making logs more explicit about "what would have changed if you’d used X here," and modestly reducing the number and frequency of top‑tier items so they feel rare and decisive.

Early stages were widely seen as too punishing: many first‑time testers died in two or three rounds and felt the system was "out to get them." I’ve since lowered early penalty damage, increased healing and defense availability, and added log information such as "how many high‑value cards have already appeared" to help players build intuition about deck state. On the meta side, faster early unlocks for extra health or item slots should reinforce the sense that "the next run will be easier." Across groups, the strongest emotions cluster around busting, perfect scores, sudden‑death triggers, and comeback moments. When several rounds pass without such peaks, mid‑run experience feels flat. To keep the dramatic arc alive, I plan to slightly adjust trigger probabilities, add extra presentation for narrow escapes and reversals, and improve resolution breakdowns and tutorials so players can more easily predict complex stacked effects instead of learning them only through long trial and error.

## Difficulties, Successes, and Personal Reflection

For me, the biggest difficulty lay in the combinatorial explosion created by freely mixing the three layers of systems, and in how to keep both logical safety and newcomer experience under control within limited time. Any small change could blow up in some rare combination, and these "hidden landmines" were present throughout development. What keeps me energized is that once players truly understand the rules, many spontaneously ask to "play a few more runs" and start describing their own behavior using words like "being greedy" or "taking a gamble." That tells me the theme really is being conveyed through mechanics rather than just copy, and that the core loop already has some stickiness and room to grow. In terms of time management, I also went through a mindset shift: at first I wanted to do almost everything—maps, events, narrative, more enemies... In the end I had to turn around and ask myself, "If I only have these few weeks left, what do I most want to preserve?" The most important takeaway from this course for me is learning to nail down the core loop first, then stack fancy features on top, instead of getting dragged around by the "fancy stuff" from day one.

## Shelved Ideas and Trade‑Offs

From the original pitch to the current build, we cut several ambitious features that now form a clear roadmap for future versions. The biggest cut was a branching stage map similar to Slay the Spire, where players would choose between combat, shops, and treasure nodes along partially hidden paths; we currently keep a linear stage flow with random environments and penalties. A more fully realized shop and treasure layer—buying specific items after battles or weighing trap‑laden chests—was also reduced to simple rewards and meta upgrades. We had also planned to give each enemy a bespoke package of environments and penalties to emphasize their playstyle (for example, a judge who favors defense or a ghost who steals your items), but for now most personality comes from drawing tendencies and base stats. On the narrative side, town NPCs, branching dialogue, and long‑term causal chains were scoped down into light UI hints and fragmentary text rather than a full story system. These cuts mark the practical boundary of this course project, but they also define a concrete roadmap: if I return to "Last Hand" later, extending the map layer, enemy loadouts, and town narrative will be the most natural next steps.
